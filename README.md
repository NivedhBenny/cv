## note
In the index.html file I used the filepath of the image uploaded in the repository as the url in a tag. 
I had to do that beacuse i uploaded the files individually to the repo. Instead i could have draged the files/folders to the repo while adding files ,thereby avoiding the need to change the url in the html file.
